# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. It serves as a practice exercise to enhance my understanding of JavaScript logic and functions.

# Game Description

The game is played against the computer. Each round, the player selects their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random selection. The winner of each round is determined based on the traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

The game consists of a single round function and a game function that plays a 5 round game, keeping score and declaring a winner or loser at the end.
